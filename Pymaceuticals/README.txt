Observations:
- The treatment regimens Capomulin and Ramicane have lower mean and median tumor volume values compared to the other regimens, this means that these two have greater 
  efficacy in reducing the size of the tumor in mice.

- Ketapril treatment to shrink tumors may vary too much, as it has a higher variance value in tumor volume, ie it may have a less consistent response compared to other treatment regimens.

- On the other hand, Capomulini has less variability in the results of its treatment compared to other regimens, which gives us a lot of information, 
   as it therefore has greater efficacy and consistency in reducing the size of the tumor, in addition, a value of Lower SEM indicates that tumor volume measures are closer to the estimated 
   population mean, in other words, treatment responses in terms of tumor volume reduction are more consistent and closer to the expected population mean.
